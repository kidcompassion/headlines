<p>“The growth and interest in pickleball has been exponential in the last few years,” said Helen Thomson, 67 &#8220;and proud of it,&#8221; at the Terwillegar Rec Centre earlier this week. The music of the rally punctuated her words, benches filled with players eager to jump into one of the six available drop-in courts.</p>
<p>Thomson is the president of the 250-member Edmonton Pickleball Club, which has seen considerable growth over the last year with increased participation and new spaces for play.</p>

<p>According to 63-year-old Doug Fogg, former member of the board of directors and current VP of Pickleball Alberta, membership more than doubled in 2017.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The club also drove the construction of new pickleball courts at the Royal Gardens Community League, completed early October. A government grant through the Alberta Lottery Fund provided $70,000 towards the redevelopment of neglected outdoor tennis courts, matched by the community league itself and conducted in partnership with the city.</p>
<p>Thirty new courts opened across the greater Edmonton area in 2017, said Fogg.</p>
<p>Pickleball is also growing provincially, said Bev Walker, president of Pickleball Alberta, which currently has 2,200 members across 18 clubs. The game has particular appeal to seniors who, according to data cited by a <a href="https://www.edmonton.ca/programs_services/documents/PDF/scs-engagement-final-report.pdf">recent city report</a>, will comprise up to 25 per cent of the province&#8217;s population by 2031.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s a sport that can be less strenuous than&#8230; some of those other racket sports,&#8221; surmised Walker.</p>
<p>Pickleball equipment is light while the court is the same size as a badminton court.</p>
<p>&#8220;But another appeal is because it&#8217;s a big paddle, it doesn&#8217;t take long to pick up a basic level of skill to go out and hit the ball and have some fun and be active,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Although many play recreationally, there are still competitive players: tournaments in the province are getting larger, said Walker.</p>
<p>Pickleball Alberta was formed in June 2016 to support Pickleball Canada Organization&#8217;s aim to be recognized as a national sports organization by 2020.</p>
<p>Doug Thomson, Helen&#8217;s 67-year-old husband and VP Operations for Pickleball Canada, partially attributes this growth to interest from younger players.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re getting a lot of younger people instead of us active older adults,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t mean to ramble on about poor wine-by-the-glass lists — especially at large Edmonton event spaces where you can find specialty food kiosks with brisket, wraps and premium seating menus offering lamb pops and sushi rolls. But nowhere to be found is a decent wine-by-the-glass list for patrons looking for something more interesting than mass-produced, commercial, high-alcohol, headache-inducing formula wines.</p>
<p>Sorry, I drifted off topic. I will whine less starting right now!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I pledge to be more grateful and thankful for all the wonderful moments, people and pleasures of life and to drink better and more thoughtfully, focusing on wines with a story, with less manipulation, no additives and are interesting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s raise our glass and toast the families and their teams that work hard to produce simple wines expressing their place of origin through vineyards using sustainable farming practices and making wines that are made with grapes. Simple.</p>
<p>These are two standout producers making wine in soils that are full of life, producing quality wines with little or no manipulation.</p>
<p><strong>MICHEL GASSIER</strong></p>
<p>Michel Gassier and his wife, Tina Gassier, are the fourth generation of this family-owned and operated winery located in the southern French Rhone Valley in Costieres de Nimes. Their philosophy is minerality, freshness and balance by focusing on soil health without using any toxic substances, using indigenous yeast, minimal use of sulphites and working “in perfect harmony with nature.” They are also certified organic. Here you have a producer with enough volume to produce wines for larger event venues with a common link — round, fresh and easy to drink. Wink, wink &#8230; nudge, nudge.</p>
<p><strong>TERRES DE MOLINES SAUVIGNON BLANC $16.50</strong></p>
<p>A fresh and zesty white wine expressing classic gooseberry notes with passion fruit, peach, mango, lime and floral, hay-like notes on a mineral-driven palate. An interesting wine with an added splash of Pinot Blanc. Sauvignon Blanc is not a grape you typically find in this region. A value-driven charmer.</p>
<p><strong>TERRES DE MOLINES MERLOT $16.50</strong></p>
<p>Merlot is another varietal that is not commonly found in Costieres de Nimes. The wine is a light and easy red with ripe red fruits, cherry, plum, vanilla and spice. It’s elegant, fruity and finishes with velvety tannins. Another terrific value from Michel Gassier!</p>
<p><strong>TH WINERY</strong></p>
<p>Tyler Harlton is a Canadian producer that follows the “organic mindset” by avoiding any manipulation, uses no chemical additives (such as Mega-purple) and minimizes the use of others, such as sulphur — he wants “the wine to be alive.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>A self-proclaimed “hands-on” winemaker right down to hand-picking individual grape bunches during harvest, versus machine-harvesting. As a matter of fact, the total number of bottles produced can be found on the back of each label.&nbsp; Tyler works with a few quality growers with contracts that allow him to have control over some of the vineyard management details such as when to pick the grapes — and that’s where you will start to see the personality of his wines come through.&nbsp; These are wines with character and complexity that are not at all like many of the homogeneous, formulated wines available on the market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you travel to the Okanagan this year, you should stop by his cosy no-frills tasting room located in the Summerland warehouse district.&nbsp; You won’t be disappointed.</p>
<p><strong>TH RIESLING $32</strong></p>
<p>I have mentioned this Riesling on more than one occasion for its all-around crowd-pleasing attractiveness. Not at all like the tense and petrol/diesel driven wines you expect from a German Riesling or the crisp/limey beauties of Australia. This is soft and rich with the complexity one expects from a wine made by hand. You will find aromas and flavours of stone fruits, honey, citrus and a creamy mineral-laden freshness. Delicious and worth it. You will find this wine on the wine list at Biera in Ritchie.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TH CABERNET FRANC $39</strong></p>
<p>I just love this grape. Harlton’s style for this vintage is a robust, fruit-driven, rich, red wine. No green or vegetal notes come through, as are often found in cool-climate Cabernet Franc wines. You will taste loads of ripe plum, raspberry and spice on a lush palate with a mineral freshness on the finish.&nbsp; There were only eight barrels of this wine made, which equals 199 cases total production. On the list at Wishbone on Jasper Avenue and the relatively new to the scene, The Butternut Tree in the Ledgeview building.</p>

<p>Alternative soul singer <a href="http://www.nuelacharles.com/">Nuela Charles</a>, country singer <a href="https://www.dandavidsonmusic.com/">Dan Davidson</a>&nbsp;and the transatlantic folk act <a href="http://www.100milehouse.co.uk/">100 Mile House</a> were picked from 28 initial nominations and a subsequent shortlist of 10 names released in December.</p>
<p>The first-place winner will receive $10,000, with the two runners-up getting $1,000 each. Winners will be announced at a reception Jan. 30.</p>
<p>This is the prize&#8217;s fifth year. It is sponsored by the City of Edmonton through the Edmonton Arts Council and administered by Alberta Music.</p>
<p>To qualify, the music work must have been released over an 18-month period prior to the late October 2017 deadline.&nbsp;A spokesperson for Alberta Music said the number of nominations has remained about the same over the past few years.</p>
<p>100 Mile House is either a duo or a band depending on how and when you manage to catch them, but husband and wife Peter Stone and Denise MacKay are at the core of things, sharing lead vocals and songwriting, with Stone doubling on guitar.</p>
<p>“We&#8217;ve been nominated before, but this is the first time we&#8217;ve been listed as finalists,” Stone said Thursday.</p>
<p>Stone was born in London, England, and went to Toronto in the early 2000s. MacKay was born in small-town Cardiff, Alta. They met on stage in Toronto in 2003 when she joined in on what she thought was an open-mic session. After that happy accident, they were destined to be creative collaborators and got married in 2004.</p>
<p>At first, they tried their luck in London, but over four years found that, by Stone&#8217;s admission, “it&#8217;s kind of a tough place to live.” That&#8217;s when the couple decided to bring their musical careers to Canada again, settling in Edmonton in 2009.</p>
<p>Hiraeth, their fourth album, reached the No. 2 spot on Earshot&#8217;s National College/Community Radio folk-roots chart and No. 1 on Edmonton&#8217;s&nbsp;CKUA, and the band was celebrated in various media.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hiraeth&#8221; is an obscure Welsh word that translates, by their take, as “a sense of nostalgia and longing for a place or person that may never have existed.” The album offers a beautiful, atmospheric mix of warm, multi-layered, mostly acoustic sounds and songs, with a melancholy tinge that usually leave you with a positive message.</p>
<p>Hiraeth&#8217;s success has a particularly sweet ring to it for Stone and MacKay, given the personal experiences behind some songs and recent events.</p>
<p>“The album talks a lot about the struggles of trying to start a family,&#8221; Stone said. &#8220;It&#8217;s been such a nice year because we got the album out there and then, after six years of trying, we had our first kid, our son, in October.”</p>
<p>Three previous releases saw 100 Mile House receive three Western Canada Music Award&nbsp;nominations, the Emerging Artist Award at the 2014 Edmonton Folk Music Festival, Songwriting Grand Prizes from the Calgary Folk Festival and two Edmonton Music Awards. Their recordings have been featured on radio as far away as Britain and Europe.</p>
<p>Apart from their music, Stone also books acts for the Empress Ale House and produces tracks for other fledgling artists. Given their new-parent status, he says it&#8217;s likely 2018 will be a quieter year for 100 Mile House, with less touring and likely no more recordings until 2019.</p>

<h3>Charles&#8217; soul</h3>
<p>Charles was already widely known after her previous soul-pop album, Aware, won the inaugural Edmonton Music Prize in 2013, among several awards. Her single, Unfortunate Love, was featured on several television shows.</p>
<p>By her own admission, creating a followup was something of a struggle in narrowing down musical options, but Charles&#8217; late 2016 seven-track album, The Grand Hustle, rose to the occasion, featuring some lush strings and a choir, with help from Toronto producer Ari Rhodes and such guests as Damhnait Doyle and Lisa Dalbello.</p>

<p>Davidson is probably best known for the decade he spent as a member of the indie-rock band Tupelo Honey. Two years ago, he chose to follow his own solo path. His second single, Found, took him to the No. 1 spot for charting indie artists in Canada in 2016 and became a gold single.</p>
<p>His second album, Barn Burner, released in late 2016, made him the Canadian Country Spotlight Artist of 2017 and he won four ACMA awards for songs or videos tied to the album. His most recent EP, Songs for Georgia, was released in October. Davidson is set to open a string of dates for Brett Kissel around Alberta in January.</p>
<p>The seven other acts short-listed for the 2017 Edmonton Music Prize in December were Dana Wylie, Farhad Khosravi, Jay Gilday, Royal Tusk, Slates, Striker and The Royal Foundry.</p>
<p>Previous winners include Maria Dunn, Scenic Route to Alaska and Moshin Zaman.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=edmontonjournal.com&#038;blog=78444591&#038;post=812160&#038;subd=postmediaedmontonjournal2&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:126:"http://edmontonjournal.com/entertainment/music/country-folk-and-soul-artists-compete-for-next-10000-edmonton-music-prize/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:47:"https://postmediaedmontonjournal2.wordpress.com";a:1:{s:5:"alexa";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:224:"Country, folk and soul artists compete for next $10,000 Edmonton Music Prize.

<p>Kowalchuk edited and interpreted the three recipe books (called receipt books at that time) for her PhD thesis, spending countless hours at the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C. to decipher the well-worn, hand-written texts. Throughout the course of her research, and just for fun, she has also made numerous dishes from the books, including &#8220;lemun creame&#8221;and &#8220;frittars of eggs and herbes.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wrote a <a href="http://edmontonjournal.com/life/food/pease-pottage-anybody-recipes-from-the-17th-century-inspire-modern-cooks">story about the book</a> back in August. It was one of those stories that I thought about for weeks after, so fascinated was I with the lives of the four women captured in Preserving on Paper. I expect diners on the 27th to come away similarly intrigued.</p>
<p>The NAIT dinner starts at 6 p.m. and will feature three courses, all based on the book. The all-in price of $105 includes wine, and a copy of the book. Kowalchuk will also speak about the book, and her research. Net proceeds from the evening go to <a href="https://www.foodforthoughtedmonton.com/">Food For Thought</a>, a non-profit school lunch and snack program that Kowalchuk runs with her family.</p>

<p>The project, approved in 2012, included building two power substations and 130 km of 240-kilovolt power lines to serve an area without transmission facilities that was expected to have significant electricity requirements because of oilsands growth.</p>
<p>The work was originally expected to cost about $370 million, an estimate Atco Electric Ltd. later boosted to $450 million, and be completed in two stages by mid-2015.</p>
<p>But only one substation at Birchwood Creek was actually constructed, and in December, the AESO told the Alberta Utilities Commission power demand in the area was lower than expected and asked to cancel the rest of the project.</p>
<p>AESO spokeswoman Tara de Weerd said Thursday the change was made after all six proposed oilsands projects — three featuring co-generation equipment that would have sent electricity back to the grid — didn&#8217;t go ahead.</p>
<p>The developments would have required a total of 500 megawatts of power, which would have boosted consumption in Fort McMurray and surrounding oilsands plants by seven to 10 per cent, she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the time when the AESO deemed this was needed, oil was significantly higher … At this point, the oil (price) is so much further down and the six projects were cancelled,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not to say the AESO will never look at this again. The resource is still there.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the fourth time in the last five years the organization, which runs the provincial power grid, has cancelled such a project.</p>
<p>Atco spent approximately $30 million building the substation and another $10 million for leases,&nbsp; engineering, stakeholder consultations and other preparatory work, expenses all ratepayers will cover, de Weerd said.</p>
<p>But the cancellation avoids putting hundreds of million of dollars more on to power bills potentially years before the extra transmission capacity is needed, she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think this demonstrates that the AESO does have Albertans&#8217; best interests truly at heart when we&#8217;re planning the system,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The AESO needs to be nimble and watch the economy and make sure we&#8217;re planning things for the long term, but also for the short term.&#8221;</p>
<p>The utilities commission has not yet ruled on the application.</p>
<p>Amberly Dooley, manager of oilsands for the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, didn&#8217;t know the details of the proposed developments, but said it&#8217;s not unusual for companies to reallocate resources.</p>
<p>While the drop in oil prices has been a major barrier to new energy investment, the association is also concerned about such factors as tax increases, methane regulations and carbon policy, Dooley said.</p>
<p>However, the association thinks the future for the oilsands is positive, she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Industry recognizes there&#8217;s still a demand that exists … (forecasts) highlight the fact there&#8217;s still room in Alberta for development to fill that demand.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Safe injection sites are wishful thinking</h3>
<p><a href="http://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/top-stories-of-2017-in-edmonton-3-the-opioid-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Re. &#8220;Opioids kill hundreds,&#8221; Dec. 28</strong></a></p>
<p class="p1">This is a terrible tragedy and health professionals need to be supported in their evidence-based efforts to prevent these deaths.</p>
<p class="p1">However, this story, like many media reports, inaccurately frames the approval of four supervised drug injection sites in Edmonton as a “positive development” in efforts to prevent these deaths.</p>
<p class="p1">In contrast, the Journal’s headline on the day after these sites were announced was &#8220;Injection sites may do little for fentanyl crisis, experts say&#8221; (Feb. 23, 2017).</p>
<p class="p1">This is because Alberta Health reported that two-thirds of Edmontonians who died from a fentanyl-related overdose in 2016 lived outside the inner city — the location of all four sites. As well, most users who ingest fentanyl take it in pill form. Many street drugs that are inhaled or smoked all too frequently are mixed with fentanyl.</p>
<p class="p1">The model of services (as currently envisioned) at the four approved sites is designed to serve clients wanting to inject drugs who most likely live in the inner city.</p>
<p class="p1">The public and policy-makers are poorly served when media and health professionals make unfounded links between complex problems and wishful solutions.</p>

<h3>Trump just winging it</h3>
<p><a href="http://edmontonjournal.com/opinion/letters/wednesdays-letters-editorial-showed-disrespect-for-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Re. &#8220;Trump didn&#8217;t deserve cheap shots,&#8221; Letters, Jan. 3</strong></a></p>
<p>I read with some amusement Edward S. Redshaw&#8217;s letter which says he is a Canadian who is &#8220;very disappointed&#8221; in the Journal&#8217;s editorial.</p>
<p>Actually, the editorial went quite easy on Mr. Trump. I would have added a few other adjectives in describing Trump, such as arrogant, idiot, liar, bully, egotistical, bigot, ignorant, clown, disgusting, unpredictable, unintelligent, dishonest, racist, narcissistic, unqualified, unfit.</p>
<p>Arguably the one word that best describes Donald Trump is incompetent. The guy is winging it. He doesn&#8217;t have a clue how to be a true leader.</p>
<p>The United States, Canada and the entire world remain in a constant state of anxiety, peril, and near-panic almost every day as Trump tweets away like some seven-year-old school yard bully sparring with another slightly younger bully boy in North Korea. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not how a president of the United States should act. As long as Trump remains in office he is a clear and present danger to our survival on this planet.</p>
<p class="p1"><em>Paul Christoffersen, Fort Saskatchewan</em></p>
<h3>Editorial freedom must be protected</h3>
<p class="p1">Mr. Redshaw’s comments seem to reflect a misunderstanding of the role that an editorial plays in a newspaper. While it is true that a paper should attempt to be impartial in its reporting of the news, there is a place for editorial opinion.</p>
<p class="p1">Editorials (and articles by columnists) are, by definition, designed to present the position of people working at the paper. If those people have a particular perspective on President Trump, it is to be expected, whether you agree with those views or not, that they will express it.</p>
<p class="p1">Attempting to muzzle editorial freedom is exactly what is going on in Trump’s America with his incessant attempts to destroy the credibility of journalists as purveyors of “fake news.“ This is an attack on democratic freedoms and must be resisted at all costs.</p>

Has David Staples heard of any feature existing in another city that he doesn't think should be installed in our river valley?
What's next? How about a huge ferris wheel, a la London? Or maybe a St. Louis-type arch (ah, maybe the new Walterdale Bridge will do)? Perhaps a large statue holding a torch that people could ascend for a view of the city?
Why the urgency to clutter an already too-cluttered river valley with more stuff? Citizens and visitors alike already give Edmonton kudos for a beautiful river valley. Why the rush to change a major draw for visitors?
Maybe the profit motive and some silly inferiority complex cause many to try to enhance the "world classness" of Edmonton.

<p>Together, they hope to give voice to stories they feel are untold. Recent profiles include a paraplegic man, a homeless veteran and a drag queen.</p>
<p>The group feels it&#8217;s able to get people to open up because of their similar experiences with mental illness, addiction, discrimination and poverty.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s different when you&#8217;ve been down that road,&#8221; said Kennedy. &#8220;You understand the needs and the wants of the people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Inspired by Humans of New York, which features short profiles of New Yorkers, Cordeiro started the Humans of Edmonton Experience Facebook page in 2014 as a space for his street photography of the homeless. But the project became tiresome, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just posted a picture up and tried to get a reaction from people,&#8221; admitted Cordeiro. He invited others to join the project in late November. &#8220;Now there&#8217;s meaning — we&#8217;re trying to help.&#8221;</p>
<p>A video posted Dec. 23 shows photographs of Zylstra delivering care packages to the homeless and their reactions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you for all you do, giving a human face to those that people just walk by and look away. Everyone deserves compassion, a smile and a kind word,&#8221; reads one comment. The page currently has about 15,500 followers.</p>
<iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/comment_embed.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhumansofedmontonexperience%2Fposts%2F1538843589533607%3Fcomment_id%3D1538956286189004&include_parent=false" width="560" height="161" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true"></iframe>
<p>The group also aims to connect people with services they need or even long-lost relatives. But just the act of disclosure can be therapeutic.</p>
<p>&#8220;The main reason we do it is to get people to share their stories and dissolve their fears,&#8221; said Tiedemann.</p>
<p>Kennedy also stressed the importance of following up with those profiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;To let them know we didn&#8217;t forget about them,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re still here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zylstra, who struggled with depression after a fire at age nine left her with facial scarring, hopes to inspire empathy in readers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ultimately, we want to try to have people walk a mile in other people&#8217;s shoes,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Nobody has the right to judge anybody no matter what situation you&#8217;re in.&#8221;</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=edmontonjournal.com&#038;blog=78444591&#038;post=811105&#038;subd=postmediaedmontonjournal2&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:121:"http://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/real-and-raw-small-group-profiles-edmontons-marginalized-on-social-media/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:47:"https://postmediaedmontonjournal2.wordpress.com";a:1:{s:5:"alexa";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:240:"'Real and raw': Small group profiles Edmonton's marginalized on social media.

<p>Reading the Dec. 20 op-ed penned by the minister of Service Alberta, I was dismayed by her continued claim of consultation with the Alberta Veterinary Medical Association (ABVMA) prior to the passing of Bill 31, A Better Deal for Consumers and Businesses Act.</p>
<p>Put simply, this claim misrepresents to the public what the actual process was. Indeed, there was no consultation with the ABVMA on the proposed amendments to the Veterinary Profession Act (VPA), only a last-minute warning that changes were coming, despite our role as regulatory body for the veterinary profession, which has been fulfilled in exemplary fashion since 1906.</p>
<p>Had there been consultation on the amendments to the VPA, the minister of Service Alberta would have gained meaningful insight into the ABVMA’s function as a regulatory body and professional association. The ABVMA governs the conduct of Alberta veterinarians, protecting the public against practices that fail to uphold the acceptable professional standards we’ve established in consultation with our members and the public.</p>
<p>Consultation would have also informed the minister about the value of self-regulated professions, and how politicians don’t always have, nor should they be expected to have, the depth of knowledge to create legislation pertaining to complex issues in highly specialized professions.</p>
<p>The ABVMA has always taken public concerns seriously, including concerns about informed consent, with well-established processes in place to address them. This is the purpose of the complaints process: fielding public concerns, conducting investigations and facilitating the process of peer review. This process, established in the VPA, holds members of our profession accountable in the interest of the public in general. I would have welcomed a call from the minister so that I might have shared with her the ways we’re already addressing issues she’s heard from a public minority who felt compelled to speak with her about price shock and disclosure, instead of addressing it directly with the ABVMA.</p>
<p>As a nonpartisan association, we have always had an excellent relationship with our provincial government, particularly with Labour Minister Christina Gray, whose ministry is responsible for the VPA. She has demonstrated that she values our input and consultation and, in turn, we have felt trusted, respected, and supported by her. We look forward to our continued work with Minster Gray, ensuring Albertans and their animals have access the highest standard of veterinary care.</p>
<p>Still, there remain several unanswered questions about why the ABVMA was completely subverted in the minister of Service Alberta’s overreaching effort to amend our governing act without our consultation. Our repeated requests for meetings with the minister of Service Alberta have been ignored and we have yet to see the findings of the public consultations that motivated amendments to the VPA in Bill 31. How odd and disappointing that a bill developed in the alleged spirit of consultation and transparency should be structured and shrouded in the opposite.</p>
<p>With the new year upon us, the ABVMA is confident we can move forward from this alarming overreach to focus and build on the positive work we’ve accomplished with the minister of Labour Christina Gray. Recently, several third-party communications have indicated that more changes are coming. While we’ve still not been consulted, we remain hopeful that our unblemished 111-year history of exemplary self-regulation is considered and that our expertise is consulted, as we continue fulfilling our mandate to protect the public interest and represent our profession, while ensuring veterinarians have the continued support of our elected officials.</p>

<p>It took a Canadian Press survey of female MPs to shine a spotlight on the bitter irony that what should be Canada&#8217;s most august workplace is apparently as riven with sexually predatory behaviour as Hollywood has turned out to be.</p>
<p>Thirty-eight of Canada&#8217;s 89 women elected to the House of Commons took part in the survey that measured the extent to which they had been targeted for sexual harassment, assault or misconduct of all kinds. Nearly 60 per cent reported that they had been subjected to one or more forms of sexual misconduct while in office, including improper comments, inappropriate gestures or sexually charged text messages.</p>
<p>Even worse, three MPs disclosed that they were victims of sexual assault while four more said they were targeted for insistent and repeated sexual advances. The alleged perpetrators included fellow MPs from the same party, MPs from other parties, lobbyists or constituents.</p>
<p>The victims, remember, are members of Parliament from all political stripes. What must the situation be for women working in jobs that are less prestigious and powerful? According to Green Party Leader Elizabeth May, these often younger, less-experienced women are at even greater risk for becoming targets of sexual misconduct.</p>
<p>The damage caused by these allegations of sexual misconduct will unfortunately do much to scuttle efforts to encourage women to run for office or to choose a career in a political system still dominated by men.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The House of Commons, mind you, is ironically the same political institution which unveiled legislation in November to crack down on harassment in federally regulated workplaces such as banks, telecommunication companies and transport providers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If passed, the rules would also apply to politicians, their staff and other employees on Parliament Hill. But new rules could take a year or more to come into effect if the bill is passed.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s shameful that such a mechanism to effectively deal with complaints of sexual harassment and mete out dire punishments for the guilty parties isn&#8217;t already in place on the Hill. Targeting sexual misconduct among our elected officials and those who work around and for them is especially imperative considering the longstanding problem of gender inequality in government.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s even more shameful, especially in this day and age, is that men elected to high office, who make our laws and lead our country would need such rules in the first place.</p>

<p>On a night that Edmonton Oilers announced mid-game that they had acquired backup goaltender <a href="https://www.hockey-reference.com/players/m/montoal01.html"><strong>Al Montoya&nbsp;</strong></a>from Montreal for a conditional draft pick, their #1 man, Cam Talbot, delivered the goods on the ice.&nbsp; Talbot matched a red-hot John Gibson save for save as the Oilers and Anaheim Ducks battled to a 1-1 sawoff through 65 minutes. The game was ultimately decided in the third round of the shootout, and by the narrowest of margins, when Ryan Nugent-Hopkins banked his perfect shot off the post and in, while Jakob Silfverberg bounced his own rocket off the iron and out.</p>
<p>It was a game the desperate Oilers absolutely had to have by whatever means necessary. On balance they were likely the better team on the night, generating more shot attempts (68-55) even as the actual shots on target were dead level at 34 apiece. Edmonton did hold a 19-15 edge in scoring chances including a 10-7 advantage in Grade A opportunities, as recorded by the&nbsp;<em>Cult of Hockey</em>&#8216;s&nbsp; David Staples (<strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xOWlg66AFyv6MkxPy3ix81RQYyql6r3fTep48_YdD9E/edit?ts=5a4eefcd#gid=0">log </a></strong>and <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r1vy2kSuKxK6ClwSyEbO8WMHNS1k9NwsQik_LPfQXl8/edit?ts=5a4f1059#gid=0"><strong>summary</strong></a>).</p>
<p>Oh, and did I mention Edmonton had Connor McDavid? The phenom was flying all night long, leading rushes, setting up chances, drawing penalties, and setting up the one Edmonton tally that broke a 2½ hour shutout streak that dated back to 2017. That goal, combined with a team defence that held the other guys under 4 for a change, was just enough to get the job done. Barely.</p>

<p><strong>#2 Andrej Sekera, 5. </strong>A quiet game, which is just what the doctor ordered at this point. Third-pairing minutes with Benning, with the Oilers moving the puck north during their watch (shot attempts were 21-12 Edmonton during Sekera&#8217;s 14 minutes at evens). Did get burned by Adam Henrique one-on-one in OT, but Talbot had his back.</p>
<p><strong>#4 Kris Russell, 7. </strong>Had 3 shot attempts and all 3 were doozies. Jumped into the rush to accept McDavid&#8217;s pass and fire home the goal that finally broke the team scoring drought; took another McDavid pass which he rattled off the crossbar, and late in the third jumped into a chaotic situation with Gibson to take RNH&#8217;s pass but couldn&#8217;t get his shot through Ryan Getzlaf&#8217;s desperation block. Blocked a couple of rockets himself in his usual station at the other end, and made another fine sliding play to preclude a shot attempt altogether which drew a nice ovation from the crowd. Was in the shooting lane on the one Ducks goal, but was unable to do much about their double deflection of Cam Fowler&#8217;s point shot. May have screened Talbot in the process but I don&#8217;t think the &#8216;tender would have been able to do much about it either.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>#6 Adam Larsson, 5. </strong>Played a strong defensive game. Officially credited with 4 hits and 4 blocked shots, both of which led the Oilers. Cleaned up a couple of messes for his partner. Jumped into the offensive zone once and fired a good shot which rang iron.</p>
<p><strong>#13 Mike Cammalleri, 7. </strong>Had an effective game on an effective line with RNH and Strome, chipping in on 5 Edmonton scoring chances in the process. His best chance was a high backhand after an RNH steal and feed, forcing a great stop from John Gibson. His 18:15 TOI was easily the most he&#8217;s played since becoming an Oiler. An extra +1 for his slick snipe in the shootout, going all the way to the side boards on the way in before bringing the puck back into the middle, then freezing Gibson with a subtle delay and deke.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>#16 Jujhar Khaira, 5. </strong>Played just 7:55 on the fourth line with Letetsu and Kassian. Generated flat nothing offensively (Oilers got outshot 5-0) but little of consequence defensively either. Had 4 hits to lead the forwards, though he came out on the receiving end of a collision with the crafty Kevin Bieksa. Blocked a shot, and won 2 of his 3 draws.</p>
<p><strong>#18 Ryan Strome, 6. </strong>Played with considerable jump in his step and made a strong contribution to the Cammalleri-RNH line. Showed his versatility by playing wing at even strength (15 minutes) and centre on the powerplay (2½), almost by default given Todd McLellan went with the rarely seen Four Pivot Powerplay on the first unit. Was in on 6 chances at evens and 1 more on the PP. Fired 3 shots on net and distributed the puck nicely as well.</p>
<p><strong>#25 Darnell Nurse, 4. </strong>A half bubble off plumb, starting with the puck over glass penalty he took early in the first period. Played a team-high 20:41 at evens, during which time Oilers got outshot 15-8, with Nurse himself torched for 6 scoring chances. A couple of iffy decisions such as the time he waved futilely at a bouncing puck in the slot instead of taking the man, who wound up getting a splendid opportunity to score. Finally got a chance himself late in overtime and nearly put the game to bed, drawing a penalty in the process. Decent stat line with 3 shots, 2 hits, 3 blocks.</p>
<p><strong>#27 Milan Lucic, 7. </strong>Was reinstated on the McDavid line in the absence of the suspended Patrick Maroon, and delivered the goods. Made the smart play on more than one occasion, namely, get the puck to McDavid and get the hell out of his way. Earned an assist on the Oilers lone goal doing just that, springing the jailbreak with a good head man pass to #97. Did similar late in regulation with a strong backcheck just outside the Anaheim blueline to again send McDavid in for a scoring chance which almost won the game outright and did draw a penalty against the scrambling Ducks. Lucic took his own penalty late in the second period &#8212; his first in twenty (20) games &#8212; for a love tap that likely scored 1 out of 10 on the Kesler Scale, but somehow got whistled; wouldn&#8217;t you know, the Ducks tallied on the powerplay. Later initiated a net drive that had the Ducks carping about goalie interference, even as it was a scrambling Fowler who crunched his own goalie. During his 14+ minutes at evens the Oilers had a whopping 22 shot attempts, just 4 against.</p>
<p><strong>#29 Leon Draisaitl, 5. </strong>Centred a largely ineffective line between young wingers Caggiula and Slepyshev, neither of whom had a strong night. Draisaitl emerged from his cocoon late in regulation when he got a shift beside his old running mate McDavid, and from there to the end of the game he was the second most dangerous player on the ice. Generated all 5 of his shot attempts in the last 7 minutes of play, a couple of which could have ended the game, the Actual Hockey part of which ended when Leon&#8217;s one-timer whistled past the post in the dying seconds of overtime. That would have made for a more satisfactory ending than the shootout, even as the distribution of points was the same. Chipped in on 7 scoring chances in all. Struggled on the dot vs. the veteran Ducks, posting just 2/9=22%. Played 21:45 in all situations, which ranked him third among Edmonton centres for goodness sake.</p>
<p><strong>#33 Cam Talbot, 8. </strong>After being lit up for 18 goals in 4 games since Christmas, showed up with his A game and snuffing ever Anaheim chance but one, a screened point drive that was deflected by Jacob Silfverberg in the slot, then again by Ryan Kesler on the doorstep. That was the only way the Ducks would beat Talbot in 65 minutes, during which time the stopper got the best of red-hot Rickard Rakell 4 times (though Rakell did beat him in the shootout), shut down Fowler alone in front, turned aside Andrew Cogliano&#8217;s drive from the slot after Nurse misplayed a bouncing puck, and robbed Henrique eyeball-to-eyeball in overtime. Credit also for a few times when Talbot calmly ended frenetic sequences around his cage by finding and freezing the puck, allowing his tuckered troops safe passage to the bench. After facing just 2 shots in the first period he faced a barrage thereafter: 15 in the second, 13 in the third, then 4 in overtime. 34 shots, 33 saves, .971 save percentage.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>#44 Zack Kassian, 5. </strong>He, like Khaira, was on a steady diet of southbound pucks (Oilers outshot 5-0 in his 8 minutes at evens), though nothing particularly dangerous. Did chip in a couple of effective minutes on the penalty kill.</p>
<p><strong>#55 Mark Letestu, 5. </strong>Not often does one see a guy who plays more on special teams (7:05) than at even strength (6:59), but Mark Letestu is no ordinary player in Todd McLellan&#8217;s master plan.&nbsp; All 3 of his shots came on the powerplay, as did all 4 of his scoring chance contributions. Was OK on the penalty kill, and on the dot (5/9=56%). Took a couple of nasty spills when he was twice tripped from behind; even as the stripes didn&#8217;t seem to notice my 7-second rewind provided ample witness.</p>
<p><strong>#58 Anton Slepyshev, 4. </strong>Made one strong move to the net front and fired a dangerous diving shot after a Draisaitl steal, but thereafter was mostly noticeable for issues at the other end of the ice. By Staples&#8217; count he was at fault on 6 Anaheim scoring chances, be it a turnover, a lost battle, a blown coverage, or in Slepy&#8217;s case on this night, all of the above at different points. That&#8217;s a ghastly number for a winger. Played just under 14 minutes during which time the Oilers more than a shot a minute, getting outshot 15-8 in his time. 1 shot, 2 hits.</p>
<p><strong>#77 Oscar Klefbom, 6. </strong>Played a team-high 24:27 without a lot of drama, contributing to 2 scoring chances, both on the powerplay, and none against. In his 18+ minutes at evens, shots on net were a relatively low-key 8-7 Oilers. Fired 7 shot attempts on the night, 4 of which were on target.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>#83 Matt Benning, 6. </strong>Returned to the line-up after a one-game sit down and responded with his best performance in some time. Played 13½ minutes at even strength, during which time the ice was tilted down hill, with Oilers firing 20 shot attempts to just 8 against. Had some effective shifts on the powerplay as well, mostly on the second unit. Had 7 shot attempts and contributed to 4 Edmonton scoring chances in all situations, just 1 against.</p>
<p><strong>#91 Drake Caggiula, 4. </strong>After spending much of the season battling Slepyshev for ice time, wound up on the same line for this night. Call them the Bobbsey Twins. Spent much of the night pinned in their own territory (Oilers got outshot 14-6 during Caggs&#8217; 12+ minutes). 1 shot, 2 hits. Did draw a penalty.</p>
<p><strong>#93 Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, 6. </strong>A weird night with plenty of action at both ends, as encapsulated by his direct involvement in 8 scoring chances on the attack but 7 the other way. Had 2 giveaways but 5 takeaways, a very high figure in the latter category (the rest of the Oilers combined for just 6). A respectavle 7/10=70% on the dot, but lost the d-zone draw that preceded the Anaheim goal. Played a whopping 22:01, but had enough gas in the tank to set up Nurse for a great chance very late in overtime. Scored the deciding tally in the shootout with an unstoppable version of his trademark shot to the Sakic Spot, just inside the stick side post.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>#97 Connor McDavid, 9.&nbsp;</strong>Played a whopping 30 shifts and led the forwards with 24:04 in ice time. Spent a good percentage of it skating at warp speed, leading the rush and challenging the Anaheim defence time and again, literally skating rings around them on more than one occasion. Set up the Oilers goal with a good decision and perfect pass to the open man, Russell, to convert the 3-on-1. Later fed Russell for another open look that found iron, then found Draisaitl several times during their brief minutes together late in the game. Drew a pair of penalties in the third period. Led the Oilers with 5 shots and 8 attempts, while contributing to 9 scoring chances in all situations vs. 0 against. 5 of those were primary contributions in the last 8 minutes of play. Nearly won the game outright with 5 seconds left in regulation, then hit the crossbar over Gibson&#8217;s shoulder from a harsh angle during overtime. Recorded an impressive 13/20=65% on the dot, including 5/8 vs. Kesler and 5/6 vs. Antoine Vermette, two of the best in the game. Did flub his shootout attempt when the puck bounced on him, so no 10&#8217;s tonight! An outstanding performance.</p>
<p><strong>#98 Jesse Puljujarvi, 7.&nbsp;</strong>Had a strong game on McDavid&#8217;s right side, at least until being replaced by Draisaitl very late in the third. Just 1 shot but plenty of good puck movement, including the early outlet to Lucic that kicked off the goal-scoring sequence, even as J.P. himself was left out of the official scoring play. Missed the net on his best chance, when McDavid set him up with a drop pass on a 2-man rush conducted at warp speed. Later deflected Lucic&#8217;s outlet pass into the path of McDavid for a breakaway that didn&#8217;t cash. Like his linemates, recorded outstanding shot shares which reflect well on all three men, even as the driver of play was clearly #97.</p>

On a night that Edmonton Oilers announced mid-game that they had acquired backup goaltender Al Montoya from Montreal for a conditional draft pick, their #1 man, Cam Talbot, delivered the goods on the ice.  Talbot matched a red-hot John Gibson save for save as the Oilers and Anaheim Ducks battled to a 1-1 sawoff through 65 minutes.
