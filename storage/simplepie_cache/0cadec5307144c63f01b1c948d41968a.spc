<p>How much business in Metro Edmonton happens outside the oil/gas/petrochemical energy sector?</p>
<p>You’d think this would be an important statistic.</p>
<p>“Diversification” comes up every time Mayor Don Iveson or Premier Rachel Notley show up at a ribbon-cutting ceremony. Say it often enough, and surely something will happen.</p>
<p>The problem is nobody knows what they are talking about.</p>
<p>In its definition of “manufacturing”, Statistics Canada includes everything to do with the processing of oil and gas, and the making of all products that supply the oil and gas extraction/processing sector.</p>
<p>We stagger about in the dark, trying to find an illusive baseline upon which to measure the reality of manufacturing businesses in Edmonton that have nothing to do with the oil patch.</p>
<p>For the next few weeks, Hicks on Biz will highlight interesting and diverse non-oil companies, how they started, grew and flourish in a town that traditionally draws its wealth from public sector employment and oil field services.</p>
<p>Along the way, hopefully some objective economic measurements will emerge that could serve as starting points to measure the future growth of non-energy-sector manufacturing.</p>
<p>Behind all the big box stores, way out Stony Plain Road just before the Henday, is RAM Elevators &amp; Lifts.</p>
<p>Through a dealership network spanning North America, RAM manufactures, sells and installs small, low-rise, commercial and home-based lifts. In its 30,000 square-foot factory, 45 skilled employees weld, paint, assemble and test some 1,000 RAM lifts/elevators a year. Administration and sales add another 20 or so people to the payroll.</p>
<p>Why in Edmonton? Simple: Founder and President Richard Meunier grew up on a Northern Alberta farm, studied mechanical engineering at the University of Alberta, and never left town.</p>
<p>“The job outlook was crappy when I graduated in 1987,” he says. He sat in on a Transportation Canada student challenge presentation – designing lifts for the mobility-impaired. Thus an industry was born.</p>
<p>“I thought it was a cool idea. I saw a long-term market in the aging population, and a growing societal awareness of access for the mobility-impaired.”</p>
<p>Coming from an entrepreneurial family with farming and trucking interests, Meunier used his engineering skills to design and build his first prototype lift on the family farm outside Busby. It worked – an inexpensive lift that met building codes and could be installed alongside short flights of stairs.</p>
<p>By the mid-&#8217;90s, Meunier realized he had to grow RAM&#8217;s market beyond Alberta. “It never occurred to me to move out of Alberta. My roots are here, my connections …”</p>
<p>With a few bumps along the road, it’s been slow, steady growth ever since, sales based on a quality, competitive product with plenty of customer/distributor support.</p>
<p>As for all the talk of Canada/Alberta/Edmonton not being competitive, Meunier shrugs his shoulders.</p>
<p>He’s compared notes with small manufacturers across North America, and concluded that things are no better, no worse in Alberta. “Some American states have lower wages, but employee health care costs are a big issue. Government here has been helpful with trade missions. Half our sales are to the USA, so we really benefit from a low Canadian dollar.”</p>
<p>Distance from markets is offset by lower transport costs. “Edmonton exporters get excellent trucking rates, because more trucks leave Edmonton empty than full.”</p>
<p>Crossing borders, and dealing with provincial/state/municipal regulations? “It’s a headache, but we’re well established and NAFTA certified. Each new product has its own learning curve to start. But once you’ve got it figured out …</p>
<p>Skilled labour isn’t a major issue – many RAM employees are 10 years or more on the job. Except during booms: “Booms are not good for us,” says Meunier. “Small manufacturers can’t compete with oil patch wages when the energy business is rocking. Today, we’re in good shape. If there’s an issue, it’s minimum wage increases. It’s not the $15 an hour – nobody here is that low. It’s the new baseline.”</p>
<p>Meunier makes 30 years of hard work sound comparatively effortless. Why hasn’t he expanded more aggressively, moved from $5-to-$10 million a year in sales to double or triple that number? Why not open a plant in the USA?</p>
<p>“Good question,” he says. “The market is out there – the population will continue to age and have mobility issues. We have a good, competitive product, well-established dealerships.</p>
<p>“It’s probably choice,” he says. “I’m fiscally conservative. I’m not sure I’d be comfortable with taking on the risk that would come with rapid expansion. Every time we’ve moved, even within Edmonton, it’s been exhausting!”</p>
<p>My take-aways from RAM Elevators and Lifts: The biggest challenge to local non-energy manufacturing are oil booms; building a successful manufacturing business out of Edmonton is no more difficult than elsewhere, that the keys to success are mostly individual persistence, focus, business insight and thorough planning.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/postmediaedmontonsun.wordpress.com/372882/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/postmediaedmontonsun.wordpress.com/372882/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=edmontonsun.com&#038;blog=126507174&#038;post=372882&#038;subd=postmediaedmontonsun&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:79:"http://edmontonsun.com/business/hicks-on-biz-whos-making-what-in-edmonton/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:42:"https://postmediaedmontonsun.wordpress.com";a:1:{s:5:"alexa";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:138:"Hicks on Biz: Who's making what in Edmonton?.

<p>On James Palliser’s famous 1865 map it’s called “Little Manito” Lake.</p>
<p>As opposed to, I guess, “Big Manito” Lake, which is the next waterbody up the Sturgeon River drainage.</p>
<p>The prolific fishing lake that the Oblate missionaries sensibly rebranded in honour of Jesus’ granny, Saint Anne.</p>
<p>The little lake a few klicks east of Onoway, where the highway more or less retraces the historic fur trade horse trail to Jasper, is officially called Lake Matchayaw.</p>
<p>Roughly translated from Cree this means bad-ass spirit lake.</p>
<p>Which is probably how it got it’s common name of Devil’s Lake.</p>
<p>I’m not sure how this benign little pond acquired a surly reputation.</p>
<p>But the Old West is full of waterbodies said to contain mean-spirited manitous known to wreck canoes and commit other anti-social mayhem.</p>
<p>Although the spirit that they say inhabits the waters of Lac Ste. Anne has undergone a miraculous character make-over.</p>
<p>Like a pro ‘rassler, it has transitioned from heel to baby face and now attracts thousands of pilgrims each summer to bathe in the lake’s heeling waters and receive the spirit of the Lord.</p>
<p>After too long being held hostage by the weather I was in need some salvation too.</p>
<p>So when my ice fishing buddy Emmerson suggested an afternoon on the hard water I couldn’t refuse.</p>
<p>Turns out we weren’t alone.</p>
<p>When we crested the rise east of Onoway where Devil’s Lake spreads below us there were probably a dozen trucks occupying the big bay beyond the boat launch.</p>
<p>None of them , from what we could tell, had sunk to the top of the cab.</p>

<p>There’s much anxiety associated with early season ice fishing.</p>
<p>When has the ice achieved the level of thickness allowing you to drive out safely.</p>
<p>Not only whether it is physically safe.</p>
<p>But when does it feel safe.</p>
<p>Here’s where the head games kick in.</p>
<p>And every time a pressure ridge shifts or the lake ice booms you wonder, is this my last walleye?</p>
<p>I’m not sure why ice angling has this strong sense of community.</p>
<p>Is it just because nobody has a clue where to fish so they sidle up to the first guy out on the false assumption he’s got it figured out?</p>
<p>Or just that misery loves company?</p>
<p>Emmerson drove through the crowd and proceeded down lake under the ridge where past experience told us the lake bottom takes a sudden drop from about five to twelve feet.</p>
<p>Which is prime pike water.</p>

<p>The first two holes we punched with the electric auger turned out to be too deep. With ice fishing it’s all about attention to detail and sweating the small stuff.</p>
<p>So we moved ashore until we were nearly in the pencil reeds and re-drilled.</p>
<p>I cleared the cuttings with the scoop and saw bottom through the murky water.</p>
<p>Perfect. Or so we hoped.</p>
<p>We erected the tent, my fox red Lab Penny assumed her prone position on the furniture moving pad Emmerson has brought along.</p>
<p>And when I lowered a chartreuse jig threaded with a frozen shiner minnow it was immediately assaulted.</p>
<p>So fast was the action that I blew the hook-set and the little pike got off.</p>
<p>After an appropriate period of atonement Pike #2 hammered the bait.</p>
<p>This time a feisty little fish came up the bore.</p>
<p>And so it went.</p>
<p>Emmerson started slow but soon picked up the pace.</p>
<p>And by the time the sun began settling behind the Bilby Natural Area and the temperature in the tent dropped 18 pike had come up and down our holes.</p>
<p>With a dozen or more long distance releases and drive-by muggings thrown in.</p>
<p>But the 12-foot holes produced nothing.</p>
<p>Time to drop the tent and stow the outfit.</p>
<p>The chinook day sunset was nothing short of stunning.</p>
<p>Back at the launch we stopped to chat with an unhappy party who said they’d only caught three.</p>
<p>I guess the devil’s in the details at Matchayaw Lake.</p>

<p>In a tough, gruelling, fiercely-contested battle of wills against one of the hotter teams in the Western Conference, the Oilers were everything their fans wanted them to be Thursday night. Poised, patient, resilient, determined and seemingly unwilling to accept anything but a win.</p>
<p>“It’s been a while since we put a performance like that together,” said captain Connor McDavid, who was at his high-flying best in the 2-1 shootout victory at Rogers Place. “It’s a good win for us.”</p>
<p>Good in the sense that if they had lost it and fallen double digits behind a wildcard spot, they were pretty much done. As it is, the mountain they have to climb between now and April is still painfully high, but what happened Thursday night at least gives them reason to believe it’s possible.</p>
<p>“At Christmas, we were four points out. That’s two wins, that’s not very much,” said McDavid. “We slipped a little bit here, and some teams found a way to get wins, but it is so tight in the West that nobody is really out of it. It is easy to say and harder to do, but we’ll find a way.”</p>
<p>Goaltender Cam Talbot, who is back to being the Cam Talbot of last year, spoke for the group when he said this game against Anaheim might have triggered the muscle memory from last year’s playoff run, reminding them what it takes to go seven games deep in the second round.</p>
<p>“We leave with some confidence against a really good team,” said Talbot, who liked how seeing Anaheim again rekindled that playoff atmosphere.</p>
<p>“You can definitely feel there&#8217;s a rivalry there. Two big, heavy teams going at it down low in front of the net. Emotions can run high in a game like this, especially a tight game.</p>
<p>“We did a good job handling ourselves against a very good team. The way we played, the way we defended, we can take a lot of positives from this game and carry it forward on the road trip.&#8221;</p>
<iframe width="690" height="300" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/378945044&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true&amp;visual=true"></iframe>
<p>And now, just as the Oilers are feeling good about themselves again, they catch a break from the schedule: Five road games in a row.</p>
<p>That’s typically bad news for most teams, but given that Edmonton has a better record on the road that they do in ice cold Rogers Place, and given that their penalty killing is fifth best in the NHL on the road and the worst in NHL history at home, this might be exactly what they need.</p>
<p>“We are definitely comfortable on the road, I’m not sure what it is,” said McDavid. “We seem to be able to find a way to put games together on the road. This is a big back-to-back here. Dallas is a team we have had trouble with in their building and Chicago as well. We have to find a way to put together two wins.”</p>
<p>The Oilers managed one goal at home in the last three games and the guy who scored it, defenceman Kris Russell, believes Thursday night was a perfect send off.</p>
<p>“I thought we were good from the start,” he said. “It’s a good sign, and it was good to do it in front of our fans, we owed them.”</p>
<p>Will it light a spark under them?</p>
<p>“It has to,” he said. “It’s that time of the year that we have to win games. We have to draw everything we can out of this game, get some confidence and take it on the road.”</p>

<p>At full speed, the Edmonton Oilers captain flew down to the other end, retrieved the puck himself and began a coast-to-coast trip that ended up being stopped after he’d gone through everybody again.</p>
<p>It was one of the most spectacular shifts of the season.</p>
<p>In the second period, he damn near did it again with another excellent effort.</p>
<p>“Shoot!” the fans yelled on that one.</p>
<p>Midway in the sandwich session, he burst in on a clear cut breakaway and was foiled by John Gibson in the Ducks net.</p>
<p>Finally, with 8:02 remaining in the period, McDavid broke in on a three-on-one and dropped it to the trailer, Kris Russell.</p>
<p>It was the Oilers&#8217; first goal in 153:43.</p>
<iframe width="690" height="300" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/378945044&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true&amp;visual=true"></iframe>
<p>It also ended the longest pointless stretch in McDavid’s career.</p>
<p>Held off the sheet in the previous three games, his assist ended his own personal drought in 256:39.</p>
<p>McDavid hadn’t produced a point since 16:07 of the first period against the Jets in Winnipeg on a goal by Jesse Puljujarvi.</p>
<p>McDavid broke in alone early in the third period and drew a penalty to provide a power play. With 5.2 seconds remaining in regulation time and the score tied 1-1, he did it again.</p>
<p>With a little puck luck we’d be talking today about watching one of the greatest games he ever played.</p>
<p>The Oilers young superstar, whom the Ducks managed to take away to some degree in the last playoffs, played possessed.</p>
<p>In the end, it was Ryan Nugent-Hopkins winning it in a shootout to end the Oilers&#8217; four-game losing streak. But make no mistakes, McDavid was the first, second and third star of this game.</p>
<p>One thing Edmonton fans have that the other 14 teams missing the playoffs don’t is the opportunity to watch McDavid every night.</p>
<p>Perhaps to remind everybody in the building, Eric Stephens sent out the tweet: “Watching Connor McDavid is worth shelling out for a ticket.”</p>

<p>Stephens or the fans in the stands Thursday night almost certainly won’t be watching him in a playoff series against the Ducks like they did in last year&#8217;s seven-game Pacific Division final.</p>
<p>And no, you probably won’t be watching him win the Hart Trophy again, either. They don’t usually give that to a player on a team that misses the playoffs.</p>
<p>It will be interesting where he sits in the minds of the voters, though. And that will be possible this year. The Professional Hockey Writers Association is going to poll the voters for a mid-season version of the awards to be released in the final week of January.</p>
<p>McDavid, who turns 21 on Jan. 13, completed the first half of his third season in the NHL Thursday with 14 goals and 32 assists.</p>
<p>Last year at the halfway point, en route to his 100-point Art Ross Trophy-winning season, he had 14 goals and 32 assists for 46 points.</p>
<p>The difference was, last year, he had a three-point lead at the turn. This year, McDavid went into the game sitting ninth in the league.</p>
<p>After 168 career NHL games, McDavid has 60 goals and 133 assists for 193 points. With his 21st birthday on the day the Oilers complete their five game road trip prior to their break, he’ll almost certainly be able to say he register 200 points before he came of age.</p>
<p>McDavid is on pace to become the fourth quickest active player and third youngest active player to reach 200 points.</p>
<p>Sidney Crosby did it in 142 games. Alex Ovechkin took 165. Evgeny Malkin did it in 166.</p>
<p>Among active NHL players only two have reached 200 points before their 21st birthday, Crosby and Steven Stamkos.</p>
<p>In Oilers history, Gretzky reached 200 points in his 117th game, Glenn Anderson in his 169th and Jari Kurri in his 177th.</p>
<p>In Oilers history, only three players reached 200 points before their 22nd birthday, Gretzky at 19 and both Paul Coffey and Mark Messier well into their 21st year.</p>
<p>As long as Edmonton has McDavid to watch, as bad as this hockey season has been here, it’s still good.</p>

<p>But you have to start somewhere and Thursday night against the Anaheim Ducks was as good a place to start as any.</p>
<p>In a thrilling finish, highlighted by a goaltending battle that came down to the final shot, Cam Talbot and the Oilers beat John Gibson and the Anaheim Ducks 2-1 in a shootout.</p>
<p>Mike Cammalleri and Ryan Nugent-Hopkins scored in the shootout as the Oilers closed the gap on Anaheim’s wildcard spot to eight points.</p>
<p>After some lukewarm efforts after Christmas, the Oilers demonstrated the urgency in this one that had been missing from so many of their games.</p>
<p>They outshot Anaheim 13-2 in the first period and even though it didn’t result in any offence for the team with the bone dry hands, at least it set the tone.</p>
<p>Offence continues to be an issue for the Oilers, who were coming off back-to-back 5-0 losses at home.</p>
<p>Their drought was almost at eight full periods at home when Kris Russell finally got one, converting a three-on-one pass from Connor McDavid at 11:58 of the second.</p>
<p>It gave Edmonton a tenuous 1-0 lead after 40.</p>
<p>The home ice penalty kill bit them again, though. The Oilers only took two penalties, but that was enough for the Ducks to score the tying goal on a man advantage 18 seconds into the third period on a Ryan Kesler deflection.</p>
<p>This game went like a lot of their recent games have gone, a pretty competitive and evenly matched tilt spoiled by some miserable power play and penalty killing.</p>
<p>“Five on five we’re good enough to beat teams,” said Leon Draisaitl. “I think special teams is what’s killing us right now. That’s not a secret. Five on five we have to bear down on our chances a little more in general. We have to make sure that if we have an open net we put it in.”</p>

<p>Bruins draft pick Oskar Steen, who got the game winner shorthanded earlier in the third period, chopped Yamamoto on the back of the leg.</p>
<p>The Oilers 2017 first-round draftee, who played nine NHL games before being sent back to his Spokane junior team, had to be helped off the ice.</p>
<p>Yamamoto may have taken the whack on a nerve and had a stinger, but the Oilers didn’t have a medical update after the game from Team USA officials, which could be a good thing. One commentator, Craig Button, thought it might be an ankle injury.</p>
<p>The Americans play the Czechs in Friday&#8217;s bronze-medal game.</p>
<p>Also on Thursday, the Oilers acquired Montreal Canadiens goalie Al Montoya for a conditional fourth-round draft pick. Montoya, who has played 159 NHL games and has another year at $1.062 million after this season, has been out for two months with a concussion. His arrival presumably means Laurent Brossoit, Cam Talbot&#8217;s backup for 13 games, will be headed to the farm team in Bakersfield.</p>

<p><strong>IN THE CORNER</strong></p>
<p>Patrick Maroon took his medicine and watched Thursday’s game from the pressbox with his first-ever NHL suspension for his head hit on Drew Doughty.</p>
<p>Maroon has never missed an Oilers game with an injury since he was acquired in a trade for Martin Gernat and a fourth-round draft pick in 2016.</p>
<p>He rested in Game 82 last April, and now he’s out with the two-game rap.</p>
<p>Maroon didn’t speak Thursday morning about the suspension but his centre, Connor McDavid, did.</p>
<p>“He’s a leader in the room, good on the ice and he’s a player we will definitely miss for two (games) but it’s a good chance for him to regroup and make sure he’s feeling good,” said McDavid, who had Milan Lucic on his left-wing against the Ducks, with Anton Slepyshev taking Lucic’s second-line left-wing role.</p>
<p>“Great opportunity to capture some ice-time,&#8221; said Oilers coach Todd McLellan, who had only played Slepyshev once in the previous eight games. &#8220;His is a bigger role than he’s had in the past.”</p>
<p><strong>CAPTAIN CONNOR</strong></p>
<p>McDavid was the leading vote-getter for the all-star game in Tampa later this month and will captain the Pacific Division squad in the three-on-three format.</p>
<p>“It’s special, definitely means a lot to me to get this (vote) from the fans in Edmonton, but around the league,” said McDavid, who’ll likely be the only Oilers player there in a struggling season. “I like the three-on-three. Gives you something to play for with a little cash prize at the end. Better than 60 minutes of five-on-five hockey where the players don’t really care.”</p>
<p>Oilers farmhand winger Ty Rattie is the Bakersfield Condors rep in the AHL all-star game. Goalie Shane Starrett (Wichita) will be playing in the ECHL all-star game.</p>
<p><strong>INJURY WOES</strong></p>
<p>Anaheim winger Andrew Cogliano, one of only three pros from the NHL, NBA or MLB to have ever appeared in 800 or more consecutive games to start their careers, suited up for his 828th straight against the Oilers.</p>
<p>Only Doug Jarvis (964) and NBA forward Johnny Kerr (1954-65, 844 games) have ever done what Cogliano’s done.</p>
<p>He played with a cold against the Oilers after getting a scare in Vancouver two nights earlier when he took a shot off his left arm. His arm went a little numb and he went to the dressing room, but returned shortly afterward.</p>
<p>“I was worried about some nerves but fortunately the shot never hit a bone,” said Cogliano, one of only four Ducks (Josh Manson, Antoine Vermette, Chris Wagner) to play every game this year.</p>
<p>Halfway through the season, they’ve lost 232 games to injury. The Oilers have lost 80.</p>
<p>When asked how his team was able to stay afloat with so many injuries in the first three months, Carlyle didn’t break stride, replying: “Coaching.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had to say it,” joked Carlyle. “Seriously, credit the players. The Ducks snoozed through the first period with only six total shots directed at Cam Talbot and lost 10 of 14 faceoffs, yet it was scoreless.</p>

<p>Brandon Zylstra is proof good things can come to those who wait.</p>
<p>Then again, it wasn&#8217;t like the former Edmonton Eskimos receiver was standing idly by passing the time before signing a reserve/future free-agent contract with the National Football League&#8217;s Minnesota Vikings on Wednesday.</p>
<p>“That was always my dream growing up, was to play for the Vikings,&#8221; Zylstra said following Edmonton&#8217;s appearance in the 2017 West Division final. &#8220;I grew up watching Randy Moss, Cris Carter, that&#8217;s what made me want to actually be a receiver.”</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t the first look the six-foot-three, 225-pound native of Minnesota got from his home state NFL club, either.</p>
<p>Before he first arrived in Edmonton ahead of 2015 training camp, the product of an NCAA Div. 3 program at Concordia-Moorhead had already been on the Vikings&#8217; radar.</p>
<p>“I got invited to Minnesota but I ended up signing with Edmonton instead and came up here,” Zylstra said of the Vikings, who had “been reaching out a little bit just because I am from Minnesota, so, like, the hometown deal. A lot of people relate mine and Adam Thielen&#8217;s story, who is a receiver there right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>As difficult a decision as it was to put those childhood NFL dreams on hold to come to Canada in order to continue his development in the three-down loop, the strategy of patience seems to have paid off. After capturing the league&#8217;s receiving title in his first full season as a Canadian Football League starter with 1,687 yards and five touchdowns on 100 catches as an all-star last year, it sounds like Zylstra has been able to translate all those stats into dollar bills that wouldn&#8217;t necessarily have been offered to him the first time around.</p>
<p>“(The) Vikings are signing CFL WR Brandon Zylstra to a futures deal today; heard they&#8217;re giving him guaranteed money well above what is standard for a CFL player. The New London-Spicer graduate is certainly worth keeping an eye on,” Minneapolis-based sports agent Blake Baratz tweeted Thursday. “Zylstra had 20 teams trying to sign him, and he’s coming home to play for his Vikings.”</p>
<p>Baratz also made the Thielen comparison: “Small school, local product, playing WR, hmm, where have I heard this story before? You’ll know his name soon enough Vikes fans.”</p>
<p>While his contract with the Eskimos wasn&#8217;t set to expire until Feb. 13, Zylstra was granted the opportunity to pursue NFL interests.</p>
<p>“The Vikings got a great football player and an even better person,” Eskimos general manager and vice-president of football operations Brock Sunderland posted on Twitter. “Thank you for all you did for the Eskimos and best of luck in the NFL.”</p>
<p>Sunderland&#8217;s wasn&#8217;t the only voice of congratulations emanating from Commonwealth Stadium, either.</p>
<p>“Congrats on a well deserved contract,” Eskimos long-snapper Ryan King tweeted. “Shout out to every single day watching you still catching balls after I finished practice, showered, changed and ate my food in the players lounge.”</p>
<p><strong>GETZLAF RETIRES</strong></p>
<p>Former Eskimos receiver Chris Getzlaf is going out in green.</p>
<p>The 34-year-old veteran of 11 CFL seasons returned to his hometown Saskatchewan Roughriders club he spent the majority of his career with after requesting his release from Edmonton on Sept. 26.</p>
<p>His season and a half with the Eskimos resulted in 46 receptions for 498 yards and three touchdowns in 26 games, contributing to his career totals of 6,192 yards and 41 touchdowns on 414 catches in 147 games.</p>
</div>
<p>“I have mixed emotions about today’s announcement,” Getzlaf said. “I am disappointed that my playing career has come to an end, but I am very proud of the 11 seasons I dedicated to being a CFL player. I want to thank the Saskatchewan Roughriders, Edmonton Eskimos and Hamilton Tiger-Cats for allowing me the opportunity to play in this great league. The friendships and memories I have created will last me a lifetime.”</p>
<p><strong>FRANKLIN SIGNS</strong></p>
<p>The Toronto Argonauts have agreed to terms on a two-year contract with ex-Eskimos quarterback James Franklin, reports 3DownNation.com&#8217;s Justin Dunk.</p>
<p>The backup to reigning CFL most outstanding player Mike Reilly, Franklin was traded to the Argos on Dec. 12 – six years to the day the Eskimos traded Ricky Ray to Toronto – in a deal that gave the Double Blue exclusive negotiation rights with Franklin, who was set to become a free agent on Feb. 13, while also sending a third-round draft pick to Toronto in return for six-foot-nine offensive lineman Mason Woods.</p>

<p>The long-time bench boss of the Pandas women’s hockey program has always had a clear-cut No.1 goaltender, but that hasn’t been the case this year.</p>
<p>After Lindsey Post graduated as the winningest goaltender in Pandas history with a 62-24-5 record and 31 shutouts, the crease responsibilities have been handed down to Dayna Owen and Kirsten Chamberlin.</p>
<p>Both goalies have put together solid seasons so far for the Pandas, but neither has cemented herself as the team&#8217;s new No.1 netminder.</p>
<p>But as the second half of the Canada West season begins, Draper wants to see one of his goaltenders take steps to emerge as the front-runner.</p>
<p>So, let the best woman win.</p>
<p>“It can be daunting for them to think they need to replace Post, but my gut feeling is they’ve moved past that feeling, and they’re in this together,” said Draper. “They recognize the opportunity that is in front of them to grow and take that next step and they’re pushing each other.</p>
<p>“The challenge for us now is to nurture that healthy competitiveness between the two of them. We want that healthy competition to see who emerges as the No.1.”</p>
<p>The defending national champion Pandas are 7-3-3-3 and host the top-ranked University of Manitoba Bisons (12-4) this weekend at Clare Drake Arena.</p>
<p>Owen was the backup behind Post the past two years, and this season, she’s earned a 5-2-0-2 record with a 1.83 goals-against average and a .904 save percentage, while Chamberlin has an impressive 5-1-1-1 record with a 1.55 goals-against average and a .926 save percentage.</p>
<p>While the Pandas don’t have an anointed No.1 goaltender yet, the duo definitely makes for a strong tandem.</p>
<p>“My thought in the second half is that if a No.1 hasn’t emerged, we have to continue to go on the way we have been and just go with our gut feeling. Judge them on their week of practice, who has the edge right now,&#8221; Draper said. “The great thing is we know we have a goaltender waiting in the wings who can come in and do just as well or even better.”</p>
<p>Owen is the more experienced of the two, but Chamberlin has been getting stronger throughout the first half and is showing that she also has the ability to be the starter if called upon.</p>
<p>“I knew there was an opportunity, and I want to push myself every day to be that starting goaltender,” said Chamberlin. “Regardless of who’s between the pipes, it’s important we push each other and our teammates in games and in practices to make sure we reach the goals we have this year.”</p>
<p>Owen knew the starting reigns weren’t simply going to be handed over to her this season, and she’s prepared to continue the battle to be the top puck stopper.</p>
<p>“I’ve always wanted to be the No.1 goaltender, and I want to make the best of this opportunity that I’ve been given,” said Owen. “We both want to be the No.1 and that’s a good thing. Both of us are new to this role, and we have to do everything we can to earn that starter’s job.</p>

<p>The Alberta Advantage is dead and the Notley NDP killed it.</p>
<p>Notley’s taxes, fees, regulations and emission controls <a href="http://business.financialpost.com/opinion/oil-and-gas-investors-are-avoiding-alberta-all-because-of-government-policies">have scared away tens of billions in investment.</a> But if the Alberta Advantage was still alive on New Year’s Day, <a href="http://edmontonsun.com/news/politics/as-carbon-tax-increase-takes-effect-ucp-vows-to-repeal/wcm/19635bc1-7ca7-40ad-a51a-e74453b74ae5">the 50 per cent increase in the carbon tax</a> finished it off.</p>
<p>Consider this, in the middle of the one of the coldest cold spells in years, the New Democrats’ carbon tax nearly doubles the cost of the natural gas most Albertans use to heat their homes.</p>
<p>Almost three-quarters of Albertans heat their homes with natural gas, the highest percentage of any province. Rich Albertans, middle-class Albertans, lower-income Albertans, we all use it.</p>
<p>That makes a carbon tax ultra regressive (meaning it hits the poor the hardest).</p>
<p>On Jan. 3, the wholesale cost of natural gas in Alberta was $1.87 per gigajoule. At $1.51 per gigajoule, the carbon tax is equal to an 81 per cent sales tax.</p>
<p>Sure, there is a rebate that will lessen the impact of the carbon tax for many Albertans. But imagine the wailing and shrieking from the NDP if they were in opposition and another party’s government had put an 81 per cent sales tax on something as essential as the fuel we use to heat our homes in -30 weather.</p>
<p>The carbon tax doesn’t increase the cost of Albertans’ total natgas bills by 81 per cent. The average bill also has a bunch of other fees – distribution charges, monthly fixed charges, reserve charges.</p>
<p>Yet even with all these add-ons, the Notley government’s carbon tax still amounts to one-quarter of our total bills.</p>
<p>Then consider the effect of the carbon tax on gasoline. It’s now nearly seven cents a litre.</p>
<p>We and other media outlets have this week carried stories <a href="http://edmontonsun.com/news/local-news/as-carbon-tax-increases-albertans-continue-to-pay-less-than-most-canadians-at-the-pump/wcm/7c4b7971-400e-485c-bb62-bccd446134bd">reassuring the public that “Albertans continue to pay less at the pump than most Canadians.”</a></p>
<p>So what? The point is, our gasoline prices are no longer the lowest. There is no clear Alberta Advantage.</p>
<p>For the first time I can remember, while travelling in Saskatchewan over the holidays, the price of gasoline was lower there than here.</p>
<p>According to price tracking site gasbuddy.com, <a href="http://www.gasbuddy.com/CAN">we&#8217;re higher even than Manitoba</a>.</p>
<p>The oil and natural gas come from here. Yet we no longer have a price advantage thanks to NDP taxes and regulations.</p>
<p>Also, as the NDP shut down our coal-fired power plants and replace them with heavily-subsidized wind farms, we are seeing electricity prices and taxpayer payouts to utility companies rise, too.</p>
<p>It’s the same with income taxes. Ours are no longer clearly the lowest in the country. They are higher than<a href="http://www.ey.com/ca/en/services/tax/tax-calculators-2017-personal-tax"> B.C. and Ontario’s, and only slightly lower than Saskatchewan</a>.</p>
<p>The NDP’s most recent emissions standards and fees have eliminated our competitive advantage there, as well, just as their increases to <a href="http://torontosun.com/business/bank-of-canada-report-estimates-60000-fewer-jobs-by-2019-due-to-minimum-wage-increases/wcm/95a73035-ee53-4443-9e72-f2a3a2178c00">our minimum wage are estimated to harm job growth</a>.</p>
<p>And what have we got to show for all these increases; for the elimination of our advantage?</p>
<p>Are there any pipelines being built with all the “social licence” we’re buying? Is the Notley government using the new revenues generated by its taxes to balance the budget or are they still running up record deficits and soaring debt?</p>
<p>On New Year’s Eve, the Notley government sent out a news release insisting their carbon tax was helping to diversify the Alberta economy. But the economies being diversified by NDP policies are those in Saskatchewan, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Texas and elsewhere. That’s where the investment dollars being scared away by the NDP are going.</p>
<p>And to top all of this off, there is almost no chance the loss of the Alberta Advantage will have much impact on the global environment.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/postmediaedmontonsun.wordpress.com/372918/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/postmediaedmontonsun.wordpress.com/372918/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=edmontonsun.com&#038;blog=126507174&#038;post=372918&#038;subd=postmediaedmontonsun&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:77:"http://edmontonsun.com/opinion/columnists/gunter-what-alberta-advantage/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:42:"https://postmediaedmontonsun.wordpress.com";a:1:{s:5:"alexa";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:92:"Gunter: What Alberta Advantage?.
