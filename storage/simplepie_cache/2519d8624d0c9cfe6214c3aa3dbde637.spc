								<p>Murad Ali Shah said on Tuesday that the process of lifting garbage and cleaning the city had started but all the institutions needed to extend their support for the Sindh Solid Waste Management Board (SSWMB) so that they could do their best.</p><p>The chief minister said this during a high-level meeting of the SSWMB at the CM House, where Local Government Minister Jam Khan said the total waste generation of the city was about 12,000 tonnes a day, of which 9,000 tonnes was generated in the municipal areas.</p><p>The remaining 3,000 tonnes of waste is generated in areas of other civic administrative bodies, such as six cantonment boards, SITE, KPT, Pakistan Railways, CAA, etc, he added. He said the SSWMB had three basic components: frontend collection, middle-end garbage transfer stations (GTSs) and backend solid waste management services such as landfill sites (LFSs).</p><p>Currently, transportation cost regarding solid waste management services is very high because the LFSs are at a distance of over 35km from the city centre, and the distance is over 50km from many areas of the city, he added.</p><p>The meeting was told that two LFSs of 500 acres each, Jam Chakro and Gond Pass, are available for disposal of the solid waste being generated across the city, but both sites are simply dumping grounds and far from international standards of sanitary LFSs.</p><p>The chief executive was told that the actual work of a GTS in Sector 12B, Korangi Industrial Area, Sharafi Goth could not be undertaken due to heaps of more than 400,000 tonnes of garbage at the site accumulated during the past three decades.</p><p>When the CM was told that the army asked them to stop building a boundary wall around the GTS in Sector 52, Korangi Town because the army claimed that the land belonged to them, Murad directed the chief secretary to the check record of rights to ascertain the actual ownership of the land.</p><p>The CM also directed the CS to resolve the matter of the GTS in Sector 26, Korangi Industrial Area, where the Landhi assistant commissioner and Korangi DMC had established some offices and were unwilling to vacate them.</p><p>Murad expressed displeasure when he was informed that the land for a GTS in Deh Okewari, East was encroached upon. He asked what the police and district administration were doing. â€œI will not spare any official if they are found to be negligent in removing encroachments.â€�</p><p>The CM also expressed displeasure when he was informed that the land for a GTS in Deh Gujhro (near Jannat Gul Hospital, Sohrab Goth), District East was occupied by land grabbers. He said he wanted the land cleared within 48 hours. â€œHow are the land grabbers able to operate under the very noses of the police and the administration?â€�</p><p>Murad was again given a cause for being annoyed when he was informed that the lands for GTSs in Deh Gangiaro, Bin Qasim, Malir and Mewashah were occupied by land grabbers.</p><p>He said: â€œThis is not a tribal area where people have developed their states within the state.â€� He directed the Karachi police chief to launch a crackdown on land grabbers and bring them to book. â€œThis must be done within 48 hours.â€�</p><p>By the time the chief executive was informed of some locals thwarting the construction of a GTS at Dhobi Ghat in District South, he seemed resigned and said in displeasure that he was not surprised at this development.</p><p>But Murad found some relief when he was informed that the GTS in Qasba Colony, DMC West was expected to start working within the next 60 days. He exclaimed: â€œThank God at least one of your sites is clear to start its operation.â€�</p><p>For the GTS in Baldia Town, DMC West, the CM directed the West DC to clear it of encroachments and report to him. As for the proposed GTS at Hawkesbay in District West, Murad directed the Board of Revenue to allocate the land to the SSWMB.</p><p>On the request of the SSWMB, the chief executive also directed the chief secretary to provide the land for the establishment of two GTSs for District Central as well as two more for District Korangi.</p><p>The CM was told that the SSWMB had plans to reserve 200 acres for a hospital waste disposal site, including an incinerator, and 300 more acres for and industrial solid waste disposal site. Meanwhile, Murad directed the commissioner and the city police chief to launch a crackdown on land grabbers and report to him. He also directed the KDA chief to submit a detailed report on the acres vacated from land grabbers.</p><p>The meeting was also attended by Information Minister Syed Nasir Shah, Chief Secretary Rizwan Memon, the Karachi commissioner, the local government secretary, SSWMB chief AD Sajnani, divisional commissioners and other relevant officers.</p>

								<p>Expressing concerns over the rise in incidents of violence against women (VAW), the Petarian Human Rights Organisation has said that shameful and inhumane acts, such as killing of women in the name of so-called honour and burying them without having a funeral for them, have been happening across Sindh.</p><p>Sharing the statistics that the Petarian Human Rights Organisation has compiled, the bodyâ€™s chairman, Ihsan Ali Khoso, said that in the past people used to forgive and forget, but now in the same province sinister incidents of â€œhonourâ€� killing are occurring. â€œIt is mainly happening in northern Sindh, where the tribal culture is still deep-rooted,â€� he said, adding that the countryâ€™s legislators had enacted laws to protect women from violence a number of times, but none of the efforts yielded any fruitful result. Â </p><p><b>â€˜Honourâ€™ killings</b></p><p>According to the Petarian Human Rights Organisationâ€™s compiled data, 63 women were killed across the province last year in the name of so-called honour. Out of the 63 cases, 12, or a little over 19 per cent, were recorded in Jacobabad district alone.</p><p><b>Domestic violence</b></p><p>One hundred and thirty-five women and girls were killed over domestic issues in the previous year. Larkana, Khairpur and Dadu top the list of places where incidents of domestic violence have resulted in deaths.</p><p><b>Sexual assaults</b></p><p>Forty women and girls, including teenagers, were raped in the preceding year. Khairpur tops the list of districts where women and girls were subjected to sexual assaults. Â </p><p><b>Suicide cases</b></p><p>One hundred and thirty-one women and girls supposedly committed suicide last year. Most of the incidents in which women and girls killed themselves were reported from the districts of Tharparkar, Khairpur, Sanghar and Hyderabad. Â </p><p><b>Burnt alive</b></p><p>According to the Petarian Human Rights Organisationâ€™s data compiled from different reports, 15 women and girls, including teenagers, were burnt alive in different incidents over different issues in the previous year.</p><p><b>Harassment, domestic abuse</b></p><p>Ninety-two cases of harassment and 99 cases of domestic abuse were reported from different parts of the province in the preceding year, as recorded by the rights organisation. Â </p><p><b>Forced marriages</b></p><p>Seventeen cases of early child marriages and forced marriages were reported last year from different parts of the province. Four, or around 24 per cent, of the 17 cases were reported from Khairpur alone.</p><p><b>No Roznamcha entries</b></p><p>Petarian Human Rights Organisation Chairman Ihsan Ali Khoso said that in most of the cases police were not informed of these incidents, while in some of the cases the police did not record the incidents in their Roznamcha (daily police diary).</p><p>In the few cases that were registered at different police stations across the province, investigations were not carried out in a proper manner, as the law enforcers did not take the cases seriously.</p>

								<p>Governor Mohammad Zubair has said the Sindh Rangers would remain deployed in Karachi to ensure stability in the cityâ€™s law and order situation, asserting that the government would never let the sacrifices rendered by law enforcers for the cause go in vain.</p><p>In a meeting with a delegation of the All City Tajir Ittehad at the Governor House on Tuesday, he spoke of the increase in economic, social, commercial and cultural activities in Karachi after a security operation was conducted for restoration of law and order.</p><p>The governor expressed pride over Karachiâ€™s journey back to being a â€˜City of Lightsâ€™ and said the situation had improved to a point where business activities continued into the late night hours.</p><p>He cited the recent visits by the spiritual heads of the Bohra and Ismaili communities as proof of the changing realities in Karachi and the perceptions of the city. â€œDignitaries and other foreign visitors felt safe and secure in Karachi. They did not feel any sort of discomfort or threats and were now keen to spend more time here,â€� said Zubair.</p><p>He added that the arrival and stay of over 20,000 foreigners in Karachi for the visit of the spiritual leader of the Bohra community during the holy month Muharram had greatly helped in promoting a positive image of the city.</p><p>The governor also lauded the resilience and perseverance exhibited by Karachiâ€™s business community in the tumultuous period preceding the 2014 security operation. â€œBusiness and commercial activities continued in this city against all odds. The resolve of Karachiâ€™s trader community denied the anti-social elements to the success they sought in their nefarious designs.â€�</p><p>Zubair said the entire nation owed a debt of gratitude to the business community for its courage in the face of exceptional pressure from anti-peace elements in the city. He said the present government had been offering all possible assistance to the authorities concerned for resolving the civic issues impeding business activities in the city.</p><p>â€œThe federal governmentâ€™s special development package announced for Karachi is aimed at restoration of civic infrastructure facilities in all commercial areas of the city. These measures include water supply, drainage and other civic facilities.â€�</p><p>He said after overcoming terrorism and other heinous crimes, the government had been focusing full attention on curbing street crimes and other petty crimes. To this end, he added, an extensive network of closed-circuit television cameras (CCTV) was being installed across Karachi.</p><p>The governor advised the tradersâ€™ delegation to contact officials of the Citizens Police Liaison Committee (CPLC) for installation of CCTV camera systems at commercial and shopping centres of Karachi.</p>

								<p>Doctors, paramedics and non-technical employees of the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) distributed sweets and presented flowers to Executive Director Dr Seemin Jamali after the Sindh government issued a long-awaited notification allowing the additional payment of half of their basic salary as health professional allowance.<p>Employees of the JPMC and National Institute of Child Health (NICH) were deprived of several privileges as the status of these healthcare facilities remains unclear after they were devolved to the provincial government through the 18th constitutional amendment.<p>A notification issued by the Sindh government, dated January 1, 2018, states that with the approval of the chief minister â€œthe Government of Sindh is pleased to allow payment of Health Professional Allowance at the rate of half of the basic pay per month to the employees of the devolved cadre of the JPMC with immediate effectâ€�.<p>Jubilant employees of the JPMC thanked Dr Jamali for resolving the longstanding matter of health allowance and hoped that other pending issues would also be resolved soon. While JPMC employees celebrated, medical, paramedical and non-technical staff of the NICH held a protest meeting at the hospital to demand that they be paid the health professional allowance on the pattern of the JPMC staff.<p>A delegation of NICH employees including doctors and paramedics met with Director Prof Dr Jamal Raza and asked him to raise the issue with the Sindh government. The protesters demanded that they be paid health professional allowance on the pattern of JPMC and agreed to defer their protest for two days after Prof Raza assured them of taking up the matter with the relevant authorities.</p>

								<p>A court on Tuesday granted bail to a police officer who was arrested for violating the ban imposed on aerial firing on New Yearâ€™s Eve.  The cop, Ejaz Mughal, had been arrested for violating Section 144 after a video appeared on social media in which he was seen firing a weapon into the night sky.<p>Sindh IGP AD Khowaja had taken notice of the incident and ordered officials to arrest Mughal. A case had been lodged at the Shah Latif police station. At yesterdayâ€™s hearing, the judicial magistrate for District Malir granted Mughal bail in the sum of Rs5,000.  The Sindh governmentâ€™s poor implementation of the ban on aerial firing to welcome the new year had not only left over 20 people, including three women and two minor boys, wounded in the city but also made it quite easy for the culprits to evade capture.</p>
